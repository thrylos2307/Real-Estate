we have created a fully functional REAL ESTATE management website for both CUSTOMER AND ADMINISTRATOR,we have developed this
site to manage all the real estate activities including buyers,agents,administrators etc.

The difference between CUSTOMER AND ADMINISTRATOR website is that some special privileges are provided to admins for managing the
database of buyer, agents like administrator can remove agents but agents cannot do so.
This is the real estate website mainly focusing on backend and database management.
